    <p>
        <h2><strong>Shirley's | Susupe, Saipan</strong></h2>
        <strong><em>Shirley's</em></strong> is best known for it's amazing fried rice, one of my personal favorites being 
        their Ground Beef Fried Rice. The menu is very diversified, guaranteeing a dish for every craving. Not to mention the serving
        sizes are great, often times one dish can feed 2-3 people.

        The once abandoned <strong><em>Mariana Lighthouse</em></strong> has now been restored and turned into a beautiful resaurant
        with a beautiful view. Along with the amazing view, customers can even enjoy a nighttime performance from dancers and a live band.
        <strong><em>Mariana Lighthouse</em></strong> even has a photgrapher that will take your photo, which you can then have printed out
        and framed right on the spot.
